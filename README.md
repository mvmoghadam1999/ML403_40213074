## WHAT we do here ##
in this repository we have some mini-projects about machine learning and 1 project.
## WHAT we do in mini_projects
in mini_projects,we cover different methods of machine learning.for example, we cover `bayes algorithm`,`MLP NetWorks`,`Decision Tree`,`SVM` and some other methods.
also we use these methods on famous datasets that you probably work with that sofare.
also in last mini project we will work on `RL`.
## WHAT we do in final project ##
in this part, we work on a image classification using `deep learning` methods and `CNN` networks. this part is a few different from what we do in mini projects.because we dont cover deep learning methods in this course and mini projects.
